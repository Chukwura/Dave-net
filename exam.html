    <p class="the">There are so many exams held in the school like JAMB, UTME, WAEC, Inter command Exam, 
        Olympiad and External Exams.
        Each examination has it's own special registration and special payment. Without the payment the student will
        not be allowed to write any of the exams so he/she has to pay any required payment to write the exams. </p>
